# Detect-and-Describe

Detect-and-Describe is an innovative model that seamlessly integrates object detection and image captioning to provide detailed, context-aware descriptions of images. By combining the power of **YOLOv5** for object detection with the **Vision Transformer (ViT)** for encoding images and **GPT-2** for generating captions, this project enhances the interpretation and understanding of visual content. It is ideal for applications requiring both object recognition and descriptive language generation, allowing users to benefit from a richer understanding of images beyond simple detection.

## Features

- **Object Detection**: Detect-and-Describe utilizes YOLOv5, a state-of-the-art real-time object detection model, to accurately identify and localize objects within images. YOLOv5 provides bounding boxes and class labels for detected objects, ensuring fast and reliable performance for real-time applications.
  
- **Image Captioning**: The model incorporates a Vision Transformer (ViT) for image feature extraction and GPT-2 for generating descriptive captions. By effectively capturing intricate visual details, the system creates coherent and contextually relevant descriptions that reflect the detected objects and their interactions within the image.

- **Contextual Understanding**: Unlike traditional models that focus on isolated object detection, Detect-and-Describe generates captions that reflect relationships between detected objects, spatial layouts, and overall scene context. This enhances interpretability, providing a deeper understanding of the visual content.

- **Modularity**: The architecture is designed to be modular, allowing users to adapt it to different datasets and image-captioning tasks. The object detection and captioning components can be customized or replaced based on specific needs.

## Use Cases

- **Automated Image Annotation**: This model can be applied to automatically label and describe images for content management systems, media libraries, or e-commerce platforms. By providing descriptive captions, it improves image searchability, retrieval, and overall user experience.

- **Accessibility**: Detect-and-Describe can enhance accessibility for visually impaired users by providing meaningful descriptions of images. These captions not only describe objects but also provide context about their relationships and the broader scene, aiding in a better understanding of visual content.

- **Data Augmentation**: The model can be used to generate contextually rich captions for datasets, serving as a valuable tool for augmenting image datasets in computer vision and natural language processing tasks. By enriching datasets with captions that include object interactions, it can help improve the training of more sophisticated models.

- **Content Moderation and Compliance**: Automatically detecting and captioning image content can be useful in scenarios where content needs to be moderated for policy violations or compliance, such as inappropriate imagery detection in social media platforms.

## Technologies Used

- **YOLOv5**: YOLOv5 is a cutting-edge real-time object detection model known for its efficiency and accuracy. It is designed to detect multiple objects in images with high speed and precision, making it ideal for applications requiring real-time object localization.

- **Vision Transformer (ViT)**: ViT is a modern neural network architecture that applies the self-attention mechanism to image patches, enabling effective image feature extraction. It is particularly well-suited for tasks involving complex visual patterns and relationships.

- **GPT-2**: A language model developed by OpenAI, GPT-2 is widely recognized for generating coherent and contextually relevant text. It is used in this project to translate image features into descriptive captions, ensuring that the generated text aligns with visual content.

- **PyTorch**: PyTorch is an open-source machine learning library used for the implementation and training of deep learning models. The flexibility and ease of use provided by PyTorch make it an ideal choice for building custom machine learning workflows.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before using the Detect-and-Describe model, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.7+
- PyTorch (with CUDA support if using a GPU)
- Torchvision
- YOLOv5 dependencies

   cd Detect-and-Describe

## Model Architecture
- **YOLOv5**: Detects objects in the input image, returning bounding boxes and class labels.
- **Vision Transformer (ViT)**: Extracts high-level features from the detected objects or the full image.
- **GPT-2**: Uses the image features as input to generate a descriptive caption.
This multi-stage process allows the model to accurately describe not only what objects are present but also how they interact within the scene.

## Performance
- Speed: **YOLOv5** ensures real-time object detection, making the entire pipeline efficient for applications requiring fast processing.
- Accuracy: **ViT** provides state-of-the-art feature extraction, capturing complex visual patterns, while **GPT-2** generates human-like captions with impressive fluency and relevance.
- The model has been trained and evaluated on **COCO** and **Flickr30k** Datasets, achieving a 0.21 score on **ROUGE** and 9.31 on **BLEU** for captioning.
